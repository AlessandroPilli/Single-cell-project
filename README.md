In this repository, you'll find my project for the "Single Cell and Spatial Omics" course, taught by Prof. Tebaldi at the University of Trento (UniTN), as part of the Master's program in Quantitative and Computational Biology.

The project's objective is outlined [here](./docs/objective.md). The unknown data I am working with can be found [here](./data/unknown_data.csv). The actual project is documented in the Rmd file, which includes detailed explanations and considerations of the work completed. You can view it [here](./project/project.Rmd).
